Home of the bi-weekly broader KERI Market and community meeting

## Wiki
We will use this repo as a wiki and for issue-handling

- schedule meeting
- prepare input documents
- take notes of meetings
- share minutes and recordings
- solve any practical/logistical issue

## Setup repo members only
Because the setup repo currently contains sensitive information about and from service providers (quotes and conditions), we need more privacy than just a Github user account to get access.

If you support and want to join the effort to set up the foundation according to [its design](https://hackmd.io/25gMXiwwSmqdVOwypSnMqw) drop a line with your GitHub username and we'll add you to the [private Setup repo](https://github.com/keri-foundation/setup).
